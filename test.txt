Redefinition of Waqf Formation: The bill stipulates that only individuals practicing Islam for at least five years can declare a Waqf, and they must own the property being endowed. It also removes the provision for "waqf by user," where long-term use could establish a property as Waqf. ​

Government Property and Waqf Status: Any government property previously identified as Waqf will cease to be recognized as such. The local Collector is empowered to determine the ownership of such properties, potentially leading to significant shifts in property status. ​

Opposition and Criticism:

Critics, including various Muslim organizations and opposition parties, contend that the bill infringes upon the constitutional rights of Muslims to manage their religious affairs. They express concerns that the inclusion of non-Muslim members and increased government oversight could lead to the confiscation of historic mosques and properties. Legal challenges are anticipated, with opposition leaders indicating plans to contest the bill in the Supreme Court. ​
